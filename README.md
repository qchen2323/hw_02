Graph 2 compares the number of on-time and delayed flights in the US from 2003 to 2016. The dataset used to create this graph included all major US airports. Based on this graph, we see that the difference between the number of on-time and delayed flights stayed consistent over the years, except for the year 2003 and 2016.
